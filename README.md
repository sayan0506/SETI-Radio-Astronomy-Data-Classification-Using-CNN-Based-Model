# SETI-Radio-Astronomy-Data-Classification-Using-CNN-Based-Model

Building a Deep CNN model for classifying four different types of radio signals captured through Allen Telescope array in SETI(Search for extraterrestrial intelligence) institute

Classifying 4 different types of radio signals from sequential data captured by Allen Telescope array in SETI in csv format, which in turn converted to 2D spectrogram data, where only initial time frame is considered for the classification problem.

In this project mainly 4 following types of radio signals are classified, which are:

>1. Squiuggle
>
>2. Narrowband
>
>3. Noise
>
>4. Narrorbanddrd
